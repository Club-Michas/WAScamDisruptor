# WhatsAppScamDisruptor
**WhatsAppScamDisruptor** is an open-source Python tool designed to ethically disrupt scam operations on WhatsApp by flooding scam numbers with automated messages. Inspired by the scambaiting community, this project helps raise awareness and waste scammersâ€™ time, so they have less of it to target real victims.
